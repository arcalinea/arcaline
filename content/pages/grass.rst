Grass

| Miles of verdant grass covers the plains,
| With the turning of the season each generation withers and dies.
| Yet wildfires cannot extinguish the inner life,
| When the spring wind blows it grows again. 
| 
| Miles of grass expands to the horizon, past ancient roads.
| Clear, crisp and green, it bridges abandoned cities.
| Again I bid farewell to my friend,
| Each blade is filled with the weight of departure.
